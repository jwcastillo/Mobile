It includes the possibility of interaction between temperature data logger device, mobile app and blockchain, where Smart Contracts implementation is the key feature.

## How to get started

To get started download the application Expo for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www) or [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?ct=www&mt=8). Then go to the [ElightMobile web site](https://expo.io/@sergeyankarenko/elightmobile) and scan the QR-code with your mobile Expo app.

You can see basic functionality of the app prototype below.

### First step: Log in via QR or try deafault demo account

### Third step: Create a "thermo logistics" contract

1) Let's make a contract;
2) Let's configure the contract then submit it;
3) Let's check the withdrawal of deposit.

### Fourth step: Manage your contract

1) Let's emulate the submitted contract;
2) Let's check the deposit is back.

## Temperature Data Logger

Here's the perfomance of Temperature Data Logger prototype. It can measure tempereature and connect via Bluetooth with mobile
